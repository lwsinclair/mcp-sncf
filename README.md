## Overview

The SNCF MCP Server provides a comprehensive interface to the French National Railway's (SNCF) API services, allowing you to:

- Plan train journeys between cities in France
- Get detailed information about train stations
- Check schedules for departures and arrivals
- Monitor service disruptions
- Find nearby places and transport options

The structure is organized as follows:

- `sncf_api/` - The main package for SNCF API interaction
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization
  - `config.py` - Configuration settings
  - `client.py` - Base API client
  - `api.py` - Main API interface combining all modules
  - `search.py` - Search-related endpoints
  - `journey.py` - Journey planning endpoints
  - `stations.py` - Station-related endpoints
  - `networks.py` - Network and transport mode endpoints
  - `disruptions.py` - Disruption-related endpoints
  - `station_finder.py` - Efficient station lookup by coordinates
  - `csv_station_finder.py` - Station lookup using CSV database
  - `vehicle_journey.py` - Detailed train journey information
- `sncf_server.py` - MCP server implementation with all tool endpoints
- `train_stations_europe.csv` - Database of European train stations with coordinates

## Features

- **Comprehensive Station Details**: Get detailed information about stations including:
  - Available transport types (trains, buses, trams)
  - Nearby places and points of interest
  - Coordinates and accessibility information

- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sncf-mcp-new.git
cd sncf-mcp-new
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If the requirements.txt file is missing, install the following packages:
requests
mcp

```bash
pip install requests pandas mcp
```

## Getting an API Key

Before using this server, you need to obtain an API key from SNCF:

1. Visit the [SNCF API Portal](https://www.digital.sncf.com/startup/api)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Subscribe to the "Navitia" API service
4. Complete the registration process
5. Once approved, you'll receive your API key in your account dashboard

The API key looks like a UUID string (e.g., `01293485-3NS3-3242-23AZ-3241324512`).

## Configuration

### Setting Up Claude Desktop

To integrate the SNCF MCP tools with Claude Desktop:

1. **Install Claude Desktop** if you haven't already
2. **Open Claude Desktop Configuration**:
   - Navigate to the Claude Desktop settings
   - Open the configuration file (usually located at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`)

```json
{
 "sncf": {
  "command": "py",
  "args": [
    "c:\\Users\\ChristianELHAJJ\\sncf-mcp-new\\sncf_server.py",
    "--api-key={YOUR-API-KEY}"
  ],
  "cwd": "c:\\Users\\ChristianELHAJJ\\sncf-mcp-new"
},
```

Replace `path/to/sncf-mcp-new` with the actual path to your installation directory.

3. **Save the Configuration File** and restart Claude Desktop

## Available MCP Tools

- `city_name`: Name of the city to search for stations
- `station_name`: Optional specific station name
- `station_id`: Optional direct station ID
- `include_transport_types`: Whether to include transport type analysis
- `include_nearby_places`: Whether to include nearby places information
- `nearby_distance`: Search radius in meters for nearby places
- `nearby_count`: Maximum number of nearby places to return

**Example prompt for Claude:**
```
What transport options are available at the main train station in Grenoble?
```

#### `get_station_schedule`

Get departure and arrival schedules for a station.

**Parameters:**
- `city_name`: Name of the city to search for stations

## Usage Examples

### Planning a Journey

You can ask Claude to plan a journey between any two cities in France:

```
I need to travel from Paris to Nice next Friday at 2 PM. Can you find me a train?
```

Claude will use the `plan_journey_by_city_names` tool to:
1. Find the main stations in both cities
2. Plan the optimal journey between them
3. Present you with departure/arrival times, durations, and connection details

### Getting Station Information

To get detailed information about a station:

```
What facilities and transport options are available at Gare de Lyon in Paris?
```

Claude will use the `get_station_details` tool to provide:
1. Basic station information (name, ID, coordinates)
2. Available transport types (trains, buses, trams)
3. Nearby places and points of interest

### Checking Train Schedules

To check upcoming departures or arrivals:

```
When are the next trains leaving from Bordeaux to Paris today?
```

Claude will use the `get_station_schedule` tool to show:
1. Upcoming departures from Bordeaux
2. Destination information
3. Platform details when available
4. Real-time status updates

### Monitoring Disruptions

To check for service disruptions:

```
Are there any disruptions affecting the Paris to Lyon route today?
```

Claude will use the `check_disruptions` tool to:
1. Find relevant disruptions
2. Explain the impact on services
3. Provide additional details about affected trains

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No API key provided"
- Ensure you've added your SNCF API key to the Claude Desktop configuration
- Check that the environment variable is correctly referenced in the MCP server configuration

#### "No stations found for city"
- Try using a more specific city name
- For smaller cities, try using the name of a nearby larger city
- The system has hardcoded coordinates for major French cities which should work reliably

#### "Failed to connect to SNCF API"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify that your API key is valid and not expired
- The SNCF API may be experiencing downtime; try again later

#### "Error initializing CSV station finder"
- Ensure the train_stations_europe.csv file is in the correct location
- Check file permissions to ensure the file is readable

## Advanced Features

### Hardcoded Coordinates

The system includes hardcoded coordinates for major French cities to ensure reliability even when the API search fails:

- Paris (48.853, 2.348)
- Marseille (43.303, 5.380)
- Lyon (45.760, 4.860)
- Toulouse (43.611, 1.454)
- Nice (43.704, 7.262)
- Nantes (47.217, -1.542)
- Strasbourg (48.585, 7.735)
- Bordeaux (44.826, -0.556)
- Lille (50.638, 3.072)
- Rennes (48.103, -1.672)
- Grenoble (45.192, 5.716)

### Transport Type Analysis

The `get_station_details` tool can analyze and categorize the types of transport available at a station:

- Long-distance trains (TGV, Intercités)
- Regional trains (TER)
- Local transit (buses, trams, metros)
- Other services (taxis, bike sharing)

### Nearby Places Search

The station details tool can find points of interest near a station:

- Other transport stops
- Public facilities
- Points of interest
- Address points

This feature is particularly useful for travelers planning their onward journey from a station.
